<h1 style="font-size:250%;text-align:center;font-family:verdana;color:orange;">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p1 style="text-align:center;font-size:150%;">The ISE is considered[according to whom?] to be one of the toughest examinations in India due to its technical nature and few posts with a selection ratio of 0.1 (based on 2018 statistics), which means one person gets selected out of every 1000.[clarification needed][awkward] Many of the officers of this service are from all over India state government colleges and third tier of colleges.[2][3][4] IES officers are mandated to manage and execute activities in diverse technical and managerial fields.

Government spending comprises more than 15 percent of India's GDP and given the extent of tasks and functions managed by the public sector, this extends to a fairly broad segment of the economy covering the railways, roads, defence, manufacturing, inspection, supply, construction, public works, power, telecommunications, etc.[5][6] All appointments to the Group A services are made by the President of India.</p1>
