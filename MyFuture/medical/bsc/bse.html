BSc is a graduate-level course in science related subjects. The students can choose between plain BSc or a BSc (Hons.) course. Those interested in fields of computers and Information technology can opt for BSc (Computer Science/IT).<br>
Although the benefits of BSc are many, most students are not aware about them. It's important for parents and teachers to educate students about the prospects of all courses they can pursue in the subject of their choice. For the students looking at careers in scientific research fields, BSc courses are the best shot at it. Moreover, BSc in India is of 3-year duration and saves the students a year or two as compared to other professional courses.
