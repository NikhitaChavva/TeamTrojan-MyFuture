	<h1  ><u>National Rural Employment Guarantee Act</u></h1>
	<h2 style="font-size: 1.65em">About</h2>
	<p>National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005 (or, NREGA No 42, later renamed as the "Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act", MGNREGA), is an Indian labour law and social security measure that aims to guarantee the 'right to work'.

It aims to enhance livelihood security in rural areas by providing at least 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.

The act was first proposed in 1991 by P.V. Narasimha Rao. It was finally accepted in the parliament and commenced implementation in 625 districts of India. Based on this pilot experience, NREGA was scoped up to cover all the districts of India from 1 April 2008.The statute is hailed by the government as "the largest and most ambitious social security and public works programme in the world". In its World Development Report 2014, the World Bank termed it a "stellar example of rural development".
The MGNREGA was initiated with the objective of "enhancing livelihood security in rural areas by providing at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year, to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work".

MGNREGA is to be implemented mainly by gram panchayats (GPs). The involvement of contractors is banned. Labour-intensive tasks like creating infrastructure for water harvesting, drought relief and flood control are preferred.[citation needed]

Apart from providing economic security and creating rural assets, NREGA can help in protecting the environment, empowering rural women, reducing rural-urban migration and fostering social equity, among others."

The law provides many safeguards to promote its effective management and implementation. The act explicitly mentions the principles and agencies for implementation, list of allowed works, financing pattern, monitoring and evaluation, and most importantly the detailed measures to ensure transparency and accountability</p>

Prescribed forms are available at every Gram Panchayat for free of cost. If anyone is charging money for prescribed forms, you are not liable to pay it as it is illegal.

Once the verification process is complete, employees are given their Job cards.
Job cards under the NREGA scheme of the Government of India:
Once your application has been verified and accepted, you will be issued a ‘Job card’.

The job card is for every rural household. A job card usually contains the names and photographs of all the members of the household.
It is a legal document that allows you to exercise your ‘Right to Work’ under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act.
Anyone possessing a Job card is eligible to apply for work under this scheme.
For preparing the labour budget, Job cards are taken into consideration.
