<p style="font-size: 150%">Meant for preparing teachers for secondary schools, this four year (earlier two year) training course is open to intermediates, with an emphasis on the principles and methodology of teaching, leading to the Bachelor of Teaching (B.T.), subsequently renamed as Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) degree. In some states there is Licentiate in Teaching (L.T.), which is considered equivalent to the B.Ed. degree. Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) is an undergraduate course offered for those interested in pursuing a career in teaching. The B.Ed. degree is mandatory for teaching at the secondary (classes 6 to 10) and higher secondary (10+2 or classes 11 and 12). The minimum qualification required for entry into B.Ed. course is intermediate (10+2). While students from the Arts stream are trained to teach subjects like History, Civics, Geography, and languages, the students from the Science stream are trained to teach Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. The duration of the course will be four years from session 2020-21 as per NCTE Regulations, 2019. After B.Ed., students can pursue Master of Education (M.Ed.) in any Indian university or teacher-training institutes offering the course. The National Council for Teacher Education is the statutory body which regulating teacher training courses in the country of India.
