Most MCA institutes accept students having mathematics as a subject either in high school (11th and 12th standards), or in graduation. They also require a minimum of 50% marks in graduation. Admissions are given on the basis of a written entrance test, Personal Interview and GD. There is centralised entrance of MCA in India at National level AIMCET (all India entrance of MCA, visit: http://www.dte.org.in/mca/) as well as each state has its own centralised entrance. Those appearing for their final year graduation exams may also apply. A student who has not studied mathematics in high school can still get admission in some places like Delhi University provided the student has scored above 55% marks in graduation.</p3>
