<h1 style="font-size:300%;text-align:center;font-family:courier;color:violet">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p1 style="font-size:200%;">A merchant navy or merchant marine or mercantile marine[1] is the fleet of merchant vessels that are registered in a specific country. On merchant vessels, seafarers of various ranks and sometimes members of maritime trade unions are required by the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW)[2] to carry Merchant Mariner's Documents.

King George V bestowed the title of the "Merchant Navy" on the British merchant shipping fleets following their service in the First World War; since then a number of other nations have also adopted use of that title or the similar "Merchant Marine." The following is a partial list of the merchant navies or merchant marines of various countries. In many countries the fleet's proper name is simply the capitalized version of the common noun ("Merchant Navy").
<h2 style="font-size:250%;font-family:verdana;color:gray;text-align:center">INDIAN MERCHANT NAVY</h2>
<p2 style="font-size:100%;">The birth of the modern Indian Merchant Navy occurred before independence from the United Kingdom, when in 1919 SS Loyalty sailed from India to Britain.[7] Today, India ranks 15th in the world in terms of total DWT. India currently supplies around 12.8% of officers and around 14.5% of ratings to the world seafaring community. This is one of the highest of any country. India trains its officers similar to coast guards with all equipment including combat training. They are trained to protect their vessels at all cost from pirates.</p2>
