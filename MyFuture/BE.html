	the Bachelor of Engineering (BE) is a professional undergraduate degree awarded after completion of four years of engineering study. Many Indian universities offer degree under the name of Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) instead of BE in engineering disciplines. Institute of national importance, like Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and National Institute of Technology (NIT) also offer B.Tech but whichever name is used, the degree course follows the standard curriculum laid down by the University Grants Commission of India (UGC), All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and National Board of Accreditation (NBA). There is no difference in the program objectives and learning outcomes of BE and B.Tech. except nomenclature. Eligibility for entry is 12 years of school education. Generally the first year (first two semesters) is common to all branches and has the same subjects of study. Courses divert after first year. The medium of instruction and examination is English. Generally, universities in India offer engineering degree in the following branches: Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Electronics and Communications Engineering, Instrumentation and Control Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Information Technology, Chemical Engineering, Biotechnology, Metallurgical Engineering, aeronautical engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Production Engineering, Biochemical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering and Agricultural Engineering. The University Grants Commission of India (UGC), All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and National Board of Accreditation (NBA) are responsible government authorities for approving engineering colleges and branches/courses. Only those universities which have been approved by these bodies can award degrees which are legally valid and are accepted as qualifiers for jobs in the central/state government and private sector.</p1>
